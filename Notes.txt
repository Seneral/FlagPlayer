PLANS:
-----
- Implement MSE (Media Source Extension) for synced, smooth playback of high-bandwidth and long videos - instead of current, crappy sync hax
- Statistically find lyrics in comments / description
- Different Layouts (Music-focussed with playlist, lyrics, etc. and Video-focussed)
- Subtitles support (custom)

BROWSING MECHANISM:
-------------------
- First page load gives csn (client-screen-nonce)
- Loading subsequent pages with csn set gives access to raw, small JSON
	1. Get URL as youtube.com$URL
	2. Get URL Hash:
		for (var hash = 0, c = 0; c < URL.length; ++c)
			hash = 31 * hash + URL.charCodeAt(c) >>> 0;
	3. Set cookie 'ST-$hash' to session-data 'itct=...&csn=...'
	4. Download URL with cookie as JSON
	5. Response automatically deletes cookie
	6. Set csn to new csn contained in response JSON
- IDEA: Get pages always as JSON with csn
	- ALWAYS get csn first from small page
	- /feed/history or /feed/library are smallest with just over 200kb
- DONT DO - session data is actually pretty stupid to get, itct is specific for every link in a page - which means, it only works visiting pages that are referenced in the current page - also, there's other stuff involved for some other pages (most notably search). Don't bother for that bit of extra data transferred

IMPORTANT KEYS:
---------------
ID_TOKEN (some youtube player id, looks important and is set as request headers, but can be omitted)
VISITOR_DATA (no idea but it's a key - maybe, a key to success?)
XSRF_TOKEN (required in request body as session_token=XSRF_TOKEN
INNERTUBE_CONTEXT_CLIENT_NAME (required in request headers as x-youtube-client-name)
INNERTUBE_CONTEXT_CLIENT_VERSION (required in request headers as x-youtube-client-version)
INNERTUBE_API_KEY (used a lot in tracking requests)
EI (playbackTracking ID, used for some stats and some content fetches - stored elsewhere in page)
