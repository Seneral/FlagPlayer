# FlagPlayer
A simple YouTube Web-App focussed on music playback
(aka small project that my subconcious thought up to prevent myself from learning for pesky exams)

- Free, easy to modify and all important stuff happens client-side
- No official YouTube API used
- No third party code used
- Standard player features (select streams freely, e.g. audio only)
- Prooven interface including dark and light theme
- Basic settings
- Save and cache playlists in local database 
- Watch page including:
	- Comments and Threads (only on custom local server)
	- Related videos (excluding mixes and livestreams for now)
	- Playlists large and small
- Search (videos only) with filtering by category
- Channel page including all tabs

## Missing standard features
- Home Page
- Subscriptions / Feeds
- Subtitles
- Download Button
- Proper synchronized DASH playback with MediaSourceExtension
- Playlist/Channel search

## Future aspirations
- Separate Database Management Site: 
	- Multi-dimensional graphs showing correlation between videos (based on metadata or even media analysis)
	- Advanced playback filtering based on tags and corresponding weights (e.g. favour a specific genre)
	- Set operations on playlists (e.g. all music minus my favourites and music older than 5 months)
- Playlists including local media (or replace youtube streams with higher quality local media)
- Experiments to extract metadata (like lyrics) from description and/or comments or from wikis/databases
- Next-up queue overriding current playlist
- Related videos browser - dive into related videos of related videos (could work great with next-up queue) 

## Known Issues
- Video Playback, especially high resolutions, are super laggy and quickly go out of sync. Proper MSE implemenentation is needed AND local CORS server, since MSE would force all streams to be routed through a CORS server
- Wrong aspect of thumbnails for videos with 1. only low resolution thumbnail AND 2. non 16-9 ratio - pretty rare
- Current video title is original (not translated), while related videos, etc. are all translated
- Most video titles are translated... (there's hope though)

## How To Use

#### Hosts:  
- Official Host (No CORS Backend): https://flagplayer.seneral.dev  

#### Local Project:  

1. Download the project
2. Load up /page/index.html
3. Search for videos or enter a playlist id in the search bar  

#### Advanced Server for comments:  

1. On Windows: Execute /server/CorsServer.bat
2. On Linux: Execute /server/CorsServer.sh
3. Note your local server adress as displayed in the console, usually http://localhost:8080
4. Open the settings in FlagPlayer (gear top right)
5. Enter local server adress into the Cors Server field
6. Reload page and enjoy comments  

Note: You need to start it every time OR set it up as a service  
You can also copy the .bat/.sh and put it on your desktop - just edit it to point to the yt-server.js file  

## Server Requirements
As any website scraping other website's content, a reverse-proxy needs to be set up so that the CORS policy doesn't block the request. There are a few freely available servers out there, but for actual usage you should NEVER rely on them:  

1. They're usually slow and not very reliable
2. They provide the service for testing purposes, NOT constant usage - you might get blocked
3. Custom local server allows you to see comments  

So follow the Instructions above to set up a local server.  
This is a modified CORS Anywhere server that differs in that it passes certain cookies and modifies the header to look like genuine same-origin requests. DO NOT host this server publicly, there are no safeguards activated to prevent abuse of your network.

## Motivation
- YouTube is terribly bloated and loads embarassingly slow
- YouTube has several bugs hindering effective playback
- YouTube forces streaming of video - even if you only use audio
- YouTube doesn't allow background music playback on mobile
- Music Playback pf mixed content (local + YouTube) is difficult
- I wanted a cross-platform music player to do experiments on
- I wanted to do a more complex webpage
- YouTube is terribly bloa- ah.

## License
The project is licensed under the AGPLv3 license - see the license file for details.
I'd appreciate a sensible usage.
